If opened as an .xlsx, cells are colorcoded by the analysis instrument/method. 

"BDL" means sample was measured, but Below Detection Limit for analysis

Purple variables (Temp, SPCOND, pH, ORP, AlkalinityS, AlkalinityW, NH3_f, H2S_f, NO3_f, Fetot, O2, Mn_f, SO4_f, As_f) were measured using the CHEMetrics Water Quality Test Kits in the field or later in the laboratory.
- Temp: Water temperature (Â°C)
- SPCOND: Specific conductance (uS/cm)
- pH
- ORP: Oxidation/Reduction Potential (mV)
- AlkalinityS: Alkalinity (mg/L), strong acid
- AlkalinityW: Alkalinity (mg/L), weak acid
- NH3_f: Ammonia, (mg/L), field, *_f is to differentiate from IC NH3
- H2S_f: Hydrogen sulfide (mg/L), field, *_f is to differentiate from IC H2S
- NO3_f: Nitrate (mg/L), field, *_f is to differentiate from IC NO3
- Fetot: Total iron (mg/L)
- O2: Oxygen (mg/L)
- Mn_f: Manganese (mg/L), field, *_f is to differentiate from IC Mn
- SO4_f: Sulfate (mg/L), field, *_f is to differentiate from IC SO4
- As_f: Arsenic (mg/L), field, *_f is to differentiate from IC As
- TotalNField: Total nitrogen (mg/L), field

All other samples were brought from Costa Rica and analyzed at Texas A&M University. Some filtered and acidified, some not?

Green variables (DOC, TDN) were measured by Jacqueline Aitkenhead-Peterson in her Nutrient and Water Analysis Laboratory (NaWa) on Shimadzu TOC-V HTCO with chemiluminescent N detection (see EPA 415.1 and Merriam et al. 1996)
- DOC: Non-Purgeable Dissolved Organic Carbon (NPOC) (mg/L)
- TDN: Total Dissolved Nitrogen (mg/L)

Yellow variables (Cl, Fl, NO2, NO3, SO4, Li, Na_IC, K_IC, Mg_IC, Ca_IC) were measured in Peter Knappett's  laboratory on 2 Dionex DX-600 Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc. Ion Chromatographs (separate for cations vs. anions). 
- Cl: Chloride (mg/L)
- Fl: Fluoride (mg/L)
- NO2: Nitrite (mg/L)
- NO3: Nitrate (mg/L)
- SO4: Sulfate (mg/L)
- Li: Lithium (mg/L)
- Na_IC: Sodium (mg/L), *_IC is to differentiate from ICPMS Na
- K_IC: Potassium (mg/L), *_IC is to differentiate from ICPMS K
- Mg_IC: Magnesium (mg/L), *_IC is to differentiate from ICPMS Mg
- Ca_IC: Calcium (mg/L), *_IC is to differentiate from ICPMS Ca

- Ba: Barium (ug/kg)
- K: Potassium (mg/kg)
- As: Arsenic (ug/kg)
- Na: Sodium (mg/kg)
- Mg: Magnesium (mg/kg)
